## 📖 About
**JusticeLinker** is a robust, secure, and user-centric platform designed to facilitate the reporting of harassment, discrimination, and other forms of injustice. By bridging the gap between victims and authorities, JusticeLinker provides a safe haven for individuals to speak up without fear, ensuring that every voice is heard, tracked, and acted upon transparently.

## ❓ Why JusticeLinker?
In many real-world scenarios, victims of harassment or injustice hesitate to come forward due to fear of retaliation, lack of accessible reporting channels, or language barriers. 

JusticeLinker solves these critical issues by offering:
- **Anonymity & Security**: Secure reporting mechanisms protecting user identity where necessary by generating completely randomized unique tracking identifiers.
- **Accessibility**: Multi-lingual interfaces (English, Telugu, Hindi) breaking down regional barriers for rural and urban populations.
- **Transparency**: Clear workflows for tracking the real-time status of complaints (Pending, In Progress, Resolved, Rejected).
- **Evidence Management**: Seamless attachment of digital evidence (images) guaranteeing immutability.

## ⚙️ Engineering Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Vite over CRA** | 10x faster Hot Module Replacement (HMR), optimized production builds |
| **JWT over Sessions** | Stateless architecture - scales horizontally effortlessly |
| **Email-based OTP** | Simple authentication for rural India - works with basic email, no third-party dependencies |
| **MySQL** | ACID compliance, reliable for structured grievance data |
| **Bucket4j with Database** | Rate limits persist across server restarts |
| **Cloudinary** | Offloads media processing, automatic optimization (WebP/AVIF) |
| **Multi-language i18n** | react-i18next for seamless EN/HI/TE support |
| **Tiered Location Data** | Pre-seeded State → District → Mandal → Village hierarchy |
| **Anonymous Complaints** | Increases trust for sensitive issues |
| **Strict Status Workflow** | Ensures proper grievance handling chain |

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Code Splitting** | React.lazy + Suspense for route-based splitting |
| **Caching** | Caffeine cache layer for rate limiting lookups |
| **Image Optimization** | Cloudinary auto-compression + WebP/AVIF serving |
| **Database Indexing** | Indexes on status, created_at, user_id columns |
| **Lazy Loading** | Images lazy-loaded, cascading dropdowns fetch on demand |
| **JWT Expiration** | 24-hour token lifetime balances security vs UX |
| **Rate Limiting** | Prevents API abuse, ensures fair resource allocation |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Hierarchical Admin Routing (Priority)
```
Complaint Submitted
       ↓
Super Admin Reviews & Assigns
       ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Authority Assignment:     │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 👮 Police Department        │ ← Law enforcement issues
│ ⚖️ Judicial Department      │ ← Legal/court matters  
│ 🏛️ General Administration  │ ← Civic/municipal issues
│ 💼 Department Admin         │ ← Specific department issues
└─────────────────────────────┘
       ↓
Department Admin Manages
       ↓
Resolution + Closure
```

**Key Points:**
- Complaints don't go directly to potentially biased departments
- Super Admin acts as initial reviewer and assigner
- Auto-escalation: Corruption complaints against Police → Judicial Department
- Department Admins can ONLY manage their assigned complaints

### Short-term (Q2 2026)
- 📱 **Mobile App**: React Native or PWA for offline-first experience
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**: Heatmaps, trend analysis by region/type
- 🔔 **Push Notifications**: In-app and browser notifications

### Medium-term (Q3-Q4 2026)
- 🤖 **AI Triage**: ML-based categorization and severity assessment
- 📄 **Document Upload**: PDF/document evidence support
- 💬 **WhatsApp Integration**: Submit complaints via WhatsApp

### Long-term (2027+)
- 🗣️ **Voice Input**: Audio complaint submission in local languages
- 🔗 **Blockchain Audit**: Immutable complaint history
- 🏛️ **Govt API**: Authorized API access for government systems
